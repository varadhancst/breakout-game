breakout game

I developed a Breakout game using object-oriented programming concepts and the Python turtle package. The game features a player-controlled paddle and a ball that bounces off the walls and breaks bricks. The player earns points for breaking bricks and loses a life if the ball falls off the screen. The game includes levels that increase in difficulty and a feature to track the player's high score. This project demonstrates my ability to use the turtle package to create a graphical game and to design and implement a program using object-oriented programming concepts.
